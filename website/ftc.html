                                    The FIRST Tech Challenge is an annual robotics competition where teams build a robot tailored to a specific challenge. I had great success in this competition, having loads of fun and eventually competing at the world championships in Houston, Texas. <br><br>
                                    During this competition, I was able to broaden my skillset. From learning about programming to even getting involved in the hardware and electrical side, I was able to become a core part of the team. <br><br>
                                    Some of the most interesting projects I worked on were a program to have the robot drive towards a specific target based on the location of an object within a camera frame using Computer Vision. I've also utilized CAD software to design and fabricate parts.
